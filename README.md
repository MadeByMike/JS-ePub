JS-ePub
=======

Just because I can. A quick and dirty example of creating an ePub with JavaScript.

Uses a number of different libraries to do some of the heavy lifting mainly JS-Zip, Handlebars and async.

If the need ever arises I'd like to take this example further with a full library. For now this is proof of concept.
